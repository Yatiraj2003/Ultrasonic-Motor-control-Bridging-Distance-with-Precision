# Ultrasonic-Motor-control-Bridging-Distance-with-Precision

• We have designed a system that is robotic arm whenever it detects the 
  obstacles in the front while travelling in the path then it takes the turn 
  clockwise/anticlockwise direction. 
  
• We have implemented this system using the ARM Microcontroller (lpc2148 
  board), we are checking the distance of obstacle from the robotic arm with the 
  help of ultrasonic sensor. 
  
• We have implemented this system in Cortex M3 development board also, we 
  have used the Tasks and Event registers in the code.
